        <ul>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> Born in Oxford, England.</li>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1962</strong> Graduates with a first class degree in physics
            at University Collage Oxford.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1963</strong> Begins research in cosmology and general
            relativity at the University of Cambridge. He is diagnosed with an
            "incurable disease" at the age of 21, which is later found to be
            Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a rare progressive disease that
            effects movement and speech. He continues with his research.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1966</strong> Completes his doctorate and is awarded a
            fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He works on
            singularities in the theory of general relativity and applies his
            ideas to the study of black holes. Collaborates with mathematician
            Roger Penrose, who was working at Birkbeck College in London.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970</strong> Discovers a remarkable property: by using
            quantum theory and general relativity he is able to show that black
            holes can emit radiation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1973</strong> Joins the department of applied mathematics
            and theoretical physics at Cambridge.In the same year he discovers,
            to his disbelief, that black holes could leak energy and particles
            into space, and even explode in a fountain of high-energy sparks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1977</strong> Appointed professor of gravitational physics
            at Cambridge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1979</strong> Appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics at
            Cambridge (a chair held by Sir Isaac Newton in 1663). Elected as a
            fellow of the Royal Society.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1982</strong> Awarded a CBE by the Queen.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1988</strong> Publishes A Brief History of Time: From the
            Big Bang to Black Holes, a classic introduction to today's most
            important scientific ideas about the cosmos. Recorded in the 1998
            Guinness Book of Records as an all-time bestseller.
          </li>
          <li><strong>1989</strong> Made a companion of honour.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1933</strong> Publishes Black Holes and Baby Universes, and
            other Essays, a collection of scientific articles exploring ways in
            which the universe may be governed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1998</strong> Publishes Stephen Hawking's Universe: The
            Cosmos Explained, a book about the basis of our existence and of
            everything around us.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001</strong> Releases Universe in a Nutshell in the UK, a
            book that unravels the mysteries of recent breakthroughs in physics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2002</strong> Releases On the Shoulders of Giants, The Great
            Works of Physics and Astronomy, an exploration of some of the

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2004</strong> Hawking announces that he has solved the Black
            Hole paradox, which has been a troubling scientists for years. He
            presents his most recent findings at the international conference on
            general relativity and gravitation in Dublin.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2018</strong> Hawkings died at his home in Cambridge, at age

            We are in danger of destroying ourselves by our greed and stupidity.
            We cannot remain looking inwards at ourselves on a small and
            increasingly polluted and overcrowded planet.
